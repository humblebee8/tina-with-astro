## Astro working with Tina

This experience is a conceptual idea behind how to use Tina with pure SSG on Astro. This also may be subject to change in the future with new support from Tina. 


### How to use it?

1. go to tina-admin site and run
    ```
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

2. Go to astro site and run.

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will launch a graphql endpoint on 4001 and the astro site should be port 3001.

3. Go to locahost:3000 and select the blog posts in the tool bar and add or edit existing posts.

4. This will commit to GitHub and kick of your CI/CD for a new build.
